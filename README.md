# go_feedback_bot
The pen trial is a golang telegram bot that allows you to receive feedback from users.

The bot does a simple thing - it forwards all the user's messages to the group that you specify. Any number of users can be in the group and everyone can respond to an incoming message. To do this, it is enough to highlight the message that the bot sent to you, click "Reply" and write a message. The bot will send this message to the user to whom you are "responding".
